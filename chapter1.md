# The Big Picture

The goal of machine learning is to discover a function $$F$$ that maps an input vector **x** to an output vector **y**.

$$F(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{y}$$

The components of **x** are called *features*. Machine learning problems can require anywhere from a dozen to tens of thousands of features.
