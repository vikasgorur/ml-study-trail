# Deep Learning

## Introduction

Deep learning became practical due to two reasons:
  - Lots of training data is now available.
  - GPUs are very, very fast (up to 70x performance of CPUs).

Classification can be used as the basis for other tasks like detection (e.g., detecting a face in an image) or ranking (e.g., search results).
