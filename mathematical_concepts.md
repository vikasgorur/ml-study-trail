# Mathematical Concepts

## Vector spaces


## Functions
There are many functions used to transform outputs in some desirable way. This is a list of them.

#### Sigmoid
A sigmoid function is any function that roughly follows the "sigmoid curve". Its value goes from 0 to 1 in a small neighborhood around 0.

The most frequently used sigmoid function is the *logistic function*:

$$s(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^-t}$$

#### Softmax
The softmax function is used to turn a n-dimensional vector of real numbers into a vector of probabilities that sum to 1.


Softmax is often used in the output layer of a neural network.
